# ðŸš€ Model Context Protocol API (MCP Server)

Welcome to the official source code repository for the **Model Context Protocol Tutorial** This is designed to help you get started with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** â€” a powerful future-ready technology to connect external context to your AI application.
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. MCP enables you to build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs and connects your models with the world.
